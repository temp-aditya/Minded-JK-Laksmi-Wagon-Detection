# Wagon Analysis and Damage Detection

## Overview
This project processes rail wagon videos to analyze their status. It determines whether a wagon is loaded or unloaded, calculates the volume of materials if loaded, and detects damages if unloaded. The output includes a report with volume calculations or damage detections along with captured images.

## Workflow

### Edge Detection & Wagon Counting
- Uses a custom-trained CNN model to detect the front and rear edges of wagons.
- Counts the number of wagons in the video.

</p>

### Wagon Classification (Loaded/Unloaded)
- A trained CNN model classifies each wagon as either "Loaded" or "Unloaded."

### Volume Calculation (For Loaded Wagons)
- Utilizes DepthAnything Large (Hugging Face) for depth estimation.
- Calculates the volume of materials using depth maps and known wagon dimensions.
- Generates a PDF report with the volume details.

### Damage Detection (For Unloaded Wagons)
- A custom-trained CNN model detects damages such as cracks or debris.
- Saves images of damaged wagons along with their wagon numbers.
- Generates a PDF report with detected damage details and images.
